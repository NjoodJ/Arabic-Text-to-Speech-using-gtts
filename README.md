# GTTS Project
This project is a small demonstration of using the GTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library in Python to convert text into speech. It provides a simple command-line interface for converting text to speech and saving the audio output as an MP3 file.

Usage
Run the gtts.py script with Python.

shell
Copy
python gtts.py
```

Enter the text you want to convert to speech when prompted.

shell
Copy
Enter the text to convert to speech: Hello, world!
```

Press Enter, and the script will convert the text to speech using the GTTS library.

The audio output will be played back using IPython.display.
